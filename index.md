## About Knwoledge (STILL DRAFT)

## Knwoledge Goals

Primary need is to collect and auto organize (at least "facet") news I read on Internet.

My primary source is  [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com) but I collect data from other souces too.
I do not use bookmarks: I tend to publish interesting articles on twitter, or sent it to a special "todo" mailbox for further reading.
I publish only things I think worth to, and I send to my todo-inbox only things I plan to use on my projects.
I use "Read Later" iPhone functionality when I have a lot of mid-priority stuff to read.
Eventually when an idea is ready for publishing, I write an article on my [Blog](https://gioorgi.com).

Some Ideas can be private, but as a primary goal should be the abiity to prepare a "Idea ReCap" with all the information is presented to be able to write an article on it.

Search is a crucial need

### Past experiment

A Wordpress site with the folloing plugin offered a good starting point:

- dw-question-answer to create a StackOverflow-like tassonomy
- elasticpress to index site via elastic search
- wpematico to aggressivly collect rss information (can be a bit dangerous for intellectual property)
- auto-upload-images to collect external images, schematics
- buddypress optional social engage
- enlighter

```python
def pythonBlock():
  pass
```
